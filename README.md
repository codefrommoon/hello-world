# About me

My name is Code, Code From Moon. You can call me CFM or CFMOON too.
I like programming and correcting code.

Lets see the behavior.
My main knowledge (and favorite) is C langage, and i practice Python. I used to code in Java too.
For learning purpose, I will not use AI, I like to "reinvent the wheel" when i develop new functionalities.
Later, I will learn this tool too.
